### Device information

IP: 10.0.0.201
Port: 4370 using for transfer data
Telnet: 23 

### Brutoforce

I tried bruteforce login and password for telnet auth but got fail because device self locking after some attempts. I used `ncrack` and password database.

### Abstract logic of work

1. Connect to device.
2. Send auth command.
3. Send command to start receive data.
4. Receive a data.
5. Close connection.

### Catched data

In wireshark_data folder you can found two dumps of Wireshark with data while communication with the device from different dates.
