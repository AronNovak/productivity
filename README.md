# Gizra Productivity 
Productity is Gizra's ERP/Project management system, and is part of The Gizra Way
methodology, the system manages the following areas:

## Features

### Time tracking
Part of the Gizra Way is to time box every development task,
and to monitor per issue time spent, this is a very hard task and therefore we
created a flow to make this easy for developers to recored there work.
The system is tightly coupled with Github, since we use Github issue queue for
all project, the system knows to pull all your work from Github and display it
in the time tracking page, leaving the developer to just type the amount of time
spent on each task.
